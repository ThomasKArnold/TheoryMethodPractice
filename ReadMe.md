# Theory, Method, and Practice
A balanced focus on theory, method, and practice is an important part of scientific progress.  Neglect of one of the three areas is like having a three legged stool with one wobbly leg.  Scientific efforts have been hampered by a focus on simple theories and a neglect of method.  Data science as a field has been neglecting theory almost completely.  This post is part of an effort to point out these deficiencies.   Corrective solutions will come later.

My focus has primarily been on living systems.  Living systems are high dimensional, chaotic, and developmental.  Most scientists focus on single dimensions, and ignore the chaotic and developmental nature of living systems.  Data scientists have stopped worrying about theory and focus on developing highly effective methods that are able to predict system behavior using high dimensional data that may contain time series data.
